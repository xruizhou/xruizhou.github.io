Welcome to my  website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Michigan, specializing in Macroeconomics, Household Finance, and International Economics.

My research focuses on understanding inflation dynamics, global supply chain disruptions, and population aging, as well as their macroeconomic implications. I am dedicated to uncovering how inflation shapes broader socio-economic outcomes and informs monetary policy and macroeconomic stability.

I work at the <a href="https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Surveys of Consumers</a>, and during the summer of 2025, I interned at the <a href="https://www.imf.org/" target="_blank">International Monetary Fund</a>.

Please contact me at xinruiz [at] umich.edu.
