Welcome to my personal website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Michigan, specializing in macroeconomics, household finance, and international economics.

My research focuses on understanding inflation dynamics, global supply chain disruptions, and population aging, as well as their macroeconomic implications. I am dedicated to uncovering how inflation shapes broader socio-economic outcomes and its consequences for monetary policy and macroeconomic stability.

I am affiliated with the Surveys of Consumers at the University of Michigan, and during the summer of 2025, I am interning at the International Monetary Fund.
