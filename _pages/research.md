**Housing over Capital: Population Aging and Asset Composition** [Full Paper](/files/aging_asset_comp.pdf)  
*Abstract:* This paper provides evidence that population aging systematically shifts asset composition, with implications for lower growth and real interest rates. Using an instrumental variable strategy based on cross-country variation in the predetermined component of population aging, I document that aging raises the share of residential housing assets while reducing the share of productive capital in national wealth. These empirical patterns align with an overlapping generations model with a housing market, in which aging reallocates household savings away from productive investment toward housing, amplifying secular stagnation dynamics.
